# Collectalogger
This is an app that allows you to track game purchases across multiple libraries, by importing them. 
Once imported, games can be viewed and searched through.
Currently, we support Steam, Epic Games, and GOG.
Game metadata (cover, description, genre, etc.) is sourced through IGDB.

This is very much a WIP as of now.
