This is an app that allows you to track game purchases across multiple libraries by importing them
from accounts.
Once imported, games can be viewed, searched, and filtered, with playtime information.
Currently, we support Steam, Epic Games, GOG, and Itch.io.
Game metadata (cover, description, genre, etc.) is sourced through IGDB.
